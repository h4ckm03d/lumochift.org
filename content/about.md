I am fulltime Software Engineer and fulltime father. ~~Rockstart developer~~ Good mentor wannabe.

I've experienced with C# (desktop programming only) since in university and from my last company [Magicsoft Asia Systems](http://magicsoft-asia.com). And also some python to build SPA(single page application) with `backbonejs`,`mongodb`,`html5`, `underscore` then continue as fullstack developer with new weapon [golang](http://golang.com) but still using old frontend weapon. Only using `mongodb`? Of course not, beside `mongodb` also use `redis`, `postgresql` as companion and using `rabbitmq`, `zeromq` as messaging system. Past project related to medical and GIS technology, create android application was a part of assignment on previous work but if must create mobile apps need many things to learn to catching up with current technology.

In the [KBSE](http://kbse.com.my) I'm working using `ASP.Net Core` and `golang` for backend. Frontend side I use `VueJS`.

Now I work as Software Engineer at [bukalapak](https://bukalapak.com).

If you curious why this site called `lumochift`, that's from anagram of my name `mochlutfi` -> `mo-ch-lu-tfi` -> `mo-ch-lu-ift` -> taraa `lumochift`.

If you have any question or maybe give me a job just mail to kapten.lufi[at]gmail.com
